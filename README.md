# Job Portal Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing job postings data from multiple portals and visualizing insights using **Tableau**.  
We applied several filters and transformations to clean the dataset and extract meaningful insights about job preferences, locations, roles, and company sizes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** → Data cleaning & preprocessing
- **Tableau** → Interactive dashboards and charts
- **Netlify** → Hosting Tableau Public dashboard
- **GitHub** → Version control and project documentation

## 📊 Key Features
1. Filtered jobs by **portals (e.g., Idealist, LinkedIn, etc.)**.  
2. Analyzed **Asian countries** with applied geographical filters.  
3. Removed **null values** and duplicates for accuracy.  
4. Custom filters:
   - Country names not starting with **A, B, C, or D**.  
   - Latitude below **10**.  
   - Company size below **50,000**.  
   - Job titles limited to **≤ 10 characters**.  
   - Work type filter: **Intern** only.  
5. Time-based visibility: Graphs were designed to appear only between **3 PM – 5 PM IST** (simulated restriction).
